Q: The program does not start. Have to install Dotnet Framework again despite being installed?<br>
A:You probably didnt choose the desktop version!<br>
<br>

<br>
Q: What is GUI-less mode?[<br>]()
A: This mode applies the Screen-Settings without the need to click on the Apply button in the GUI. Saves you two clicks :)<br>

A: Rename or delete the screen.cfg file in the directory where the .exe is located.<br>
<br>
Q: Uh I messed something up. How do I reset it?<br>

<br>
Q: What is that Volume thingy which i can't click?
A: Some coming up feature :)<br>
